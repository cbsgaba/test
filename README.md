## Morlet wavelet-based feature extraction algorithm with Fuzzy logic for an Iris Recognition System with Non-ideal images

1.Image acquisition (using dummies -> MMU iris image datasets)

2.Iris segmentation

2.1  Conversion of RGB image to Grayscale

2.2 Binarization 

2.3 Canny Edge 

2.4 Circular Hough Transform


## Updates

version 1.1 added main script, segmentation function first half (rgb2gray, imbinarized)

version 1.2 added segmentation function second half (edge,cht)

version 1.3 added normalization

version 1.4 added feature extraction
